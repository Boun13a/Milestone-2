# Milestone-2

This project is about an Air Transmission System that works as client, opnening the 3 different files "C-FGAX.txt/C-GEFC.txt/C-QWWT.txt" which contains all the details for each flight. 
Reading the each line by line with a 1 second delay in between, format the string to the appropriate format required in the document and send this to the Server which is Ground Terminal System.

This Client Air Transmission System will be developed by: Mohamed Halbouni

Note: I already have another repo "MileStone" which has some code for the Air Transmission System. But this repo will be the cleaner version. 
Note: I had to use this current repo "Milestone-2" since i needed to do a lot of research on how to use GitHub
